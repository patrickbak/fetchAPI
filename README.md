# fetchAPI

Application requires a properly set React.js library to run it on a server (ex. localhost). I advice to use Visual Studio Code because there it's really easy to do it. Simply start an application with create-new-app command in console after installing node.js and react on your computer. Then you can copy those files into folders (replace App.js with JSTut.js, css file with mainstyle.css and change html file in public folder). After that you can go into directory of your project (cd 'main folder') and to start the server just type npm start.

The app takes an information from server and puts it below form.
